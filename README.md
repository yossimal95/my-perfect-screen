# my-perfect-screen
A small program that takes an image and turns it into fullscreen.

You may ask: what is good for..?
Ill tell you, well lets say you are doing whatever on your PC and you need to leave the area for a while, 
in the meantime youll want your screen be nice and innocent.

Youll just need to put an image right next to the EXE file, run it, click the button and - Walla! the image covers your whole screen.

P.S. the program UI is in Hebrew and supports two screens at once.
